# Contributing to HAP

HAP is open because trust infrastructure should be shared. We welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help restore trust in hiring.

## What We Welcome

- **New Verification Authorities** - Implement HAP and join the ecosystem
- **Spec clarifications** - Help make the specification clearer
- **SDK improvements** - Bug fixes, performance, new languages
- **Documentation** - Guides, examples, translations
- **Employer integration guides** - Help employers adopt HAP

## Writing Guidelines

When contributing to HAP documentation or code, follow these principles:

### Voice

- **Direct and confident.** No hedging or corporate speak.
- **Human-first.** Write for the job seeker wondering if anyone cares.
- **Technical but accessible.** Employers aren't all developers.

### Avoid

- Marketing fluff ("revolutionize," "game-changer," "synergy")
- Vague promises ("makes hiring better")
- Jargon without explanation
- Over-engineering simple concepts

### Prefer

- Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Clear statements of what IS and ISN'T included
- Honest acknowledgment of limitations
- Simple solutions that work

## The Design Principle

Every design decision should answer: **Does this help real humans demonstrate genuine effort?**

If the answer is no, or "maybe for enterprise features," reconsider.

## How to Contribute

### For Documentation/Spec Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b improve-docs`)
